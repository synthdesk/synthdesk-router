## scope

the router exists solely to constrain downstream interpretation
of epistemic artifacts.

the router will never:
- generate advice
- imply intent
- rank alternatives
- optimize outcomes
- reference pnl or performance
- interface with execution systems
- adapt based on outcomes

any system requiring those behaviors is out of scope.
