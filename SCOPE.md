## scope

the router exists solely to constrain downstream interpretation
of epistemic artifacts.

in-scope artifacts include:
- governance specifications (constitution, schema, veto matrix)
- the human-authored belief layer (EXPECTATIONS.md / STRATA.md / VIOLATIONS.md)

the router will never:
- generate advice
- imply intent
- rank alternatives
- optimize outcomes
- reference pnl or performance
- interface with execution systems
- adapt based on outcomes

any system requiring those behaviors is out of scope.
