## auditability

every router output must be:
- reproducible from identical inputs
- attributable to specific sources
- explainable without reference to outcomes
- attributable to the belief basis in force (EXPECTATIONS.md / STRATA.md), when used by an enforcement layer

router correctness is evaluated on structural and semantic validity,
not downstream success.
