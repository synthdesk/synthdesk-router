synthdesk-router is a constitutional restraint layer.

it aggregates and constrains epistemic artifacts produced by upstream systems.
it does not decide, advise, route, optimize, or execute.

this repository contains:
- governance specifications (constitution, schema, veto matrix)
- a human-authored belief layer that grounds router authority:
  - EXPECTATIONS.md (active, provisional regime beliefs)
  - STRATA.md (historical regimes & deep priors)
  - VIOLATIONS.md (append-only contradictions against belief)

this repository contains governance specifications only.
no executable logic is defined here.

machine-readable does not imply executable.
