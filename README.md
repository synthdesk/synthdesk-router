synthdesk-router is a constitutional restraint layer.

status
epoch freeze — router runtime birth

on 2025-12-20, router v0 was executed on the production vps.
it attached to the live canonical event spine and emitted exactly one:

  router.permission: allow

upon observing a new factual spine event.
no further output occurred.
no files were modified.
no systemd services were touched.

this confirms router runtime birth.
permission is now downstream of truth. commit this text.
tag it if you want (router-runtime-birth-2025-12-20).

it aggregates and constrains epistemic artifacts produced by upstream systems.
it does not decide, advise, route, optimize, or execute.

this repository contains:
- governance specifications (constitution, schema, veto matrix)
- a human-authored belief layer that grounds router authority:
  - EXPECTATIONS.md (active, provisional regime beliefs)
  - STRATA.md (historical regimes & deep priors)
  - VIOLATIONS.md (append-only contradictions against belief)

this repository contains governance specifications only.
no executable logic is defined here.

machine-readable does not imply executable.
