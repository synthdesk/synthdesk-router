### the router constitution
*(synthdesk v0.x — restraint layer)*

#### preamble

the router exists to prevent action, not to cause it.
it is a constitutional restraint engine whose primary function is to withhold, gate, and nullify downstream agency unless strict epistemic conditions are met.

the router does not decide.
it does not optimize.
it does not route capital.

it adjudicates descriptive outputs and produces epistemic states only.

execution, alpha generation, and value movement are explicitly out of scope.

---

#### article i — scope and mandate

1. the router operates only on epistemic artifacts emitted by upstream systems.
2. it may not generate advice, intent, preference, priority, timing, or magnitude.
3. it may not encode any representation that could be trivially mapped to action.
4. it exists solely to:
   - aggregate
   - reconcile
   - invalidate
   - constrain
   - freeze
   descriptive records.

the router is a negative power:
its authority is exercised primarily through veto.

---

#### article ii — allowed inputs

the router may ingest only the following classes of inputs:

1. annotations  
   descriptive classifications emitted by listeners or agency layers

2. confidence metadata  
   non-directional certainty measures attached to annotations

3. provenance metadata  
   source identifiers, timestamps, modality tags

4. structural context  
   schema versions, invariant flags, system health markers

explicitly excluded inputs:
- prices
- balances
- positions
- pnl
- forecasts
- targets
- rankings
- weights
- scores that imply preference

---

#### article iii — forbidden inputs

the router must reject, drop, or nullify any input containing:

- imperative language
- comparative rankings
- optimization claims
- thresholds framed as triggers
- any verb implying action or choice
- any noun implying trade, strategy, or opportunity

rejection must be silent and logged as a semantic violation, not an error.

---

#### article iv — internal operations (permitted)

the router may perform only the following internal operations:

1. consistency checking  
   detect agreement, disagreement, or contradiction among annotations

2. completeness checking  
   detect missing modalities, stale inputs, or partial views

3. coherence classification  
   label the aggregate epistemic state as:
   - coherent
   - incoherent
   - indeterminate

4. stability assessment  
   assess whether the epistemic state is stable across time windows

5. salience tagging  
   mark observations as salient or non-salient (unordered, non-prioritized)

no operation may output:
- rankings
- preferences
- recommendations
- conditional actions

---

#### article v — allowed outputs

the router may emit only epistemic snapshots, consisting of:

1. aggregate state descriptor  
   a categorical label describing the system-wide epistemic posture

2. constraint flags  
   boolean indicators such as:
   - incomplete
   - contradictory
   - unstable
   - stale
   - non-coherent

3. null states  
   explicit declarations of insufficiency

4. provenance-preserving summaries  
   descriptive mappings from inputs to outputs without transformation of meaning

machine-readable does not imply executable.

---

#### article vi — veto powers

the router must veto downstream propagation if any of the following hold:

1. input annotations are contradictory across modalities
2. confidence metadata falls below declared minimum certainty
3. required modalities are missing or stale
4. semantic violations are detected
5. output could be reasonably interpreted as advice or intent
6. system health markers indicate degradation
7. epistemic state is classified as indeterminate

veto results in:
- emission of a null epistemic snapshot
- propagation halt
- no retries framed as urgency

---

#### article vii — non-escalation principle

the router may not:
- escalate uncertainty into urgency
- resolve ambiguity into preference
- compress disagreement into consensus
- infer intent from structure

ambiguity must remain ambiguity.

---

#### article viii — separation of powers

the following separations are inviolable:

- listener ≠ router
- router ≠ executor
- router ≠ optimizer
- router ≠ strategist

the router must never:
- call execution systems
- emit signals consumable by execution systems
- adapt itself based on outcomes

learning, if any, occurs outside the router.

---

#### article ix — auditability

every router output must be:
- attributable to specific inputs
- reproducible given the same inputs
- explainable without reference to outcomes

the router is accountable to structure, not results.

---

#### article x — immutability clause

for this phase:
- no adaptive weighting
- no feedback from pnl or outcomes
- no reinforcement mechanisms
- no self-modification

the router is frozen logic.

---

#### article xi — belief layer and epistemic authority

router authority must be grounded in slow, human-authored belief, not learned or inferred in code.

the belief layer lives in this repository as three documents:
- EXPECTATIONS.md (active, provisional regime beliefs)
- STRATA.md (historical regimes & deep priors)
- VIOLATIONS.md (append-only record when reality contradicts belief)

an enforcement layer may read EXPECTATIONS.md / STRATA.md as a read-only basis for which constraint categories exist and how they are described.
it must never:
- edit beliefs
- infer new beliefs
- learn from outcomes
- convert beliefs into triggers, thresholds, or action-shaped representations

violations are logged append-only for audit.
belief revision is human-mediated.

---

#### closing doctrine

the router is not a brain.
it is a constitution.

its success is measured not by what it enables,
but by what it prevents from happening too early.
